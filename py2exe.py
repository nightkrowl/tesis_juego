# This program was created by Clint (HanClinto) Herron for the April 2007 PyWeek competition.
#
# It packages up basic games created with the Skellington app as EXE files.
# It requires that py2exe be installed on your system.
# Simply run this script, and it will take care of the rest.
#
# This source program is released into the public domain

print "INTRODUCTION:"
print "This program packages up basic games created with the Skellington framework."
print "It works on my machine for my game,"
print "but I can't guarantee that it will work on yours for yours."
print "Py2exe generally does a great job of automatically packaging dependencies,"
print "but I can't guarantee you won't need to tweak with all of this."
print "Still, I hope this give you a good push in the right direction.\n"

# First step is to create a temporary launcher file, similar to the run_game.py file, that has the name of the EXE that they wish to create. This is a workaround to a problem where EXEs created with py2exe cannot be renamed to anything other than that which they were originally created with (or else they won't run properly). I don't know of the proper py2exe option to fix this.

program_listing = "#This is an automatically generated file that can be deleted\nimport main\nmain.main()" # The basics needed to run a game packaged with the skellington
filename = 'Slacker.py' # The name of the temporary launcher script to create

filename = raw_input("What is the name of the executable that you wish to create (example: BubbleKong.exe or Slacker.exe) ? ")
package_name = filename.replace(".exe", "") # Remove .exe from the end of the file (if it was added at all)
filename = package_name + ".py" # Add .py to the end so that we can create this as a script file

print "\nCreating our launcher script file '" + filename + "'\n"

FILE = open(filename,"w")
FILE.write(program_listing)
FILE.close()

# Now that we have our script file, we add command line arguments to execute py2exe with the proper bundle options
